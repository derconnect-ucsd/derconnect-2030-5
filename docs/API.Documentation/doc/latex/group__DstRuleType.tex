\subsection{Detailed Description}
Bit map encoded rule from which is calculated the start or end time, within the current year, to which daylight savings time offset must be applied.

The rule encoding\+:

Bits 0 -\/ 11\+: seconds 0 -\/ 3599

Bits 12 -\/ 16\+: hours 0 -\/ 23

Bits 17 -\/ 19\+: day of the week 0 = not applicable, 1 -\/ 7 (Monday = 1)

Bits 20 -\/ 24\+: day of the month 0 = not applicable, 1 -\/ 31

Bits 25 -\/ 27\+: operator (detailed below)

Bits 28 -\/ 31\+: month 1 -\/ 12

Rule value of 0x\+F\+F\+F\+F\+F\+F\+FF means rule processing/\+D\+ST correction is disabled.

The operators\+:

0\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the Day of the Month

1\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the Day of the Week that is on or after the Day of the Month

2\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the first occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

3\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the second occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

4\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the third occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

5\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the forth occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

6\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the fifth occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

7\+: D\+ST starts/ends on the last occurrence of the Day of the Week in a month

An example\+: D\+ST starts on third Friday in March at 1\+:45 AM. The rule...
