\subsection{Detailed Description}
Charges contain charges on a customer bill. These could be items like taxes, levies, surcharges, rebates, or others. This is meant to allow the H\+AN device to retrieve enough information to be able to reconstruct an estimate of what the total bill would look like.

Providers can provide line item billing, including multiple charge kinds (e.\+g. taxes, surcharges) at whatever granularity desired, using as many Charges as desired during a billing period. There can also be any number of Charges associated with different Reading\+Types to distinguish between T\+OU tiers, consumption blocks, or demand charges.
