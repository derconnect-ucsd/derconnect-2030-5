\subsection{Detailed Description}
A \hyperlink{structSchedule}{Schedule} organizes the events of a particular function set for an End\+Device in terms of the rules in section 12.\+1.\+3 Event Rules and Guidlines. 

Events are assigned to an \hyperlink{structEventBlock}{Event\+Block} which can belong to one of three queues, {\ttfamily scheduled}, {\ttfamily active}, and {\ttfamily superseded}. Event\+Blocks that correspond with server events that have been marked Canceled or Superseded belong to none of these queues and are eventually removed from the schedule when the events expire.

Initially all Event\+Blocks are inserted into the {\ttfamily scheduled} queue using the rules for overlapping and nested events. Future events that are superseded by scheduling are marked {\ttfamily Schedule\+Superseded} and are placed in the superseded queue. If the set of events changes for some reason, these events may eventually rejoin the {\ttfamily scheduled} queue.

When Event\+Blocks in the scheduled queue become active (i.\+e when the current time matches the effective start time) they are transfered to the {\ttfamily active} queue, in the process they may be superseded by existing active Event\+Blocks or they may supersede other active Event\+Blocks. In these cases the superseded Event\+Blocks are removed from the schedule and a Response is sent to the server with the response status Event\+Superseded.

If an \hyperlink{structEventBlock}{Event\+Block} is sucessfully transfered to the {\ttfamily active} queue and the Event\+Status.\+current\+Status retrieved from the server is Active then an internal E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+RT event is generated for current time. If the Event\+Status.\+current\+Status is Scheduled, then the event will be marked {\ttfamily Active\+Wait} and remain in the active queue, but the E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+RT event will only be generated when current\+Status for the event changes to Active. When the \hyperlink{structEventBlock}{Event\+Block} expires (i.\+e the current time matches the effective end time) or it is superseded then an internal E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+E\+ND event is generated at that time for the \hyperlink{structEventBlock}{Event\+Block}.
